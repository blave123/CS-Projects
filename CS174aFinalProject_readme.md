# CS-Projects
A demo of this project can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdtPn-jFB7U&ab_channel=Blave //video file too large to be added to repo /n
Main code can be found in snake.js where I contributed to the code in whole, 
working alone in functions: gameWonScreen, gameLostScreen, startGameSetup, getGameState, display, reset, Boundaries, Snake
and lead in the creation of the control of the snake, the interface/creation of flags to change screens, and the mechanics of the game(movement, collision, victory/death flags)
